    "## Assessment Goal\n",
    "The goal of this assessment is to design a simple text sentiment analyzer using Python and TextBlob.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assessment Weight\n",
    "15% out of the total mark allocated for the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assessment Type\n",
    "This is a **group** “practical” assignment, which means each group is expected to work on the assignment requirements on their own and submit their work based on their own efforts. Each group consists of **3-4 students**.\n",
    "Assessment Specifications and Description\n",
    "As the name suggests, sentiment analysis means to identify the view or emotion behind a situation. It basically means to analyze and find the emotion or intent behind a piece of text or speech or any mode of communication. In this Assessment, we will focus on the sentiment analysis of text data.\n",
    "__________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "We, humans, communicate with each other in a variety of languages, and any language is just a mediator or a way in which we try to express ourselves. And, whatever we speak or write, has a sentiment associated with it. It might be positive or negative or it might be neutral as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis has a wide range of applications across various industries. One of its most common uses is in the field of social media monitoring, where companies and brands leverage sentiment analysis to gain insights into customer opinions and reactions to their products or services. This information can help them make data-driven decisions, refine marketing strategies, and improve customer satisfaction. Sentiment analysis is also valuable in the financial sector, where it is used to analyze market sentiment and news sentiment to make more informed investment decisions. In the realm of customer support, sentiment analysis can be employed to gauge customer satisfaction and identify potential issues in real-time, allowing businesses to respond proactively. Moreover, sentiment analysis has applications in healthcare, politics, and even in the field of academic research to analyze public sentiment, assess public policies, and understand emotional trends within specific domains. Overall, sentiment analysis is a versatile tool that provides valuable insights into human emotions and opinions, making it applicable in a wide array of fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple sentiment analyzer can be built using TextBlob. TextBlob is a popular Python library for natural language processing (NLP) that simplifies the complexities of working with textual data. It offers a straightforward and user-friendly interface for various NLP tasks, including text classification, part-of-speech tagging, sentiment analysis, translation, and more. TextBlob is built on top of NLTK and Pattern, two other NLP libraries, making it easy to perform common NLP operations with just a few lines of code. It also provides a range of pre-trained models and datasets, making it accessible for users without extensive NLP expertise. Whether you need to analyze sentiment in customer reviews, categorize text documents, or perform basic language processing tasks, TextBlob is a versatile and efficient tool that simplifies NLP tasks in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assessment, you are asked to develop an intelligent solution which classifies the sentiment in Amazon reviews. A potential user of the solution is a producer or a seller on Amazon who would like to analyze their product’s reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Dataset Description\n",
    "In this assessment, you will use a dataset of Amazon reviews of unlocked phone. PromptCloud extracted 400 thousand reviews of unlocked mobile phones sold on Amazon.com to find out insights with respect to reviews, ratings, price and their relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    "*You may access the dataset via this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/amazon-reviews-unlocked-mobile-phones*\n",
