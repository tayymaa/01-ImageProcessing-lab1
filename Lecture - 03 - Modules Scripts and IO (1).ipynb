    "Python script is a collection of commands in a file designed to be executed like a program. ‎The file can of course contain functions and import various modules, but the idea is that it ‎will be run or executed from the command line or from within a Python interactive shell to ‎perform a specific task. ‎\n",

    "It is also possible in order to execute this script as a standalone program, by executing the ‎script inside a shell terminal (Linux/Mac console or cmd Windows console). For example, if ‎we are in the same directory as the test.py file, we can execute this in a console:‎\n",

    "\tVALUE\n",
    "````\n",

    "\n",
    "\"VALUE {0}\" is what we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take another example. Suppose to the format() function, we pass three ‎values: 10, 20 and 30.\n",
    "Typically, when we count positions or indexes, we start from 0.‎\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To print the first value, you need to pass in an index of 0. To print the second value, pass an ‎index of 1.\n",
