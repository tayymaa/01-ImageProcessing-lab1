    "A list comprehension is a syntactic construct, which makes creating a list from a list easier and nicer. It handles the overhead of creating the new list for you, resulting in code that simpler, and often just a one-liner. The code is more readable, and easier to understand.\n",

    "Python also includes a powerful sorted function which returns a sorted version of a list. It can also take a key function that tells sorted how to actually sort the objects. For more information, look at Python's documentation for the sorted method. Note that sorted is stable, meaning if two values are equal according to the key function, their relative positions will stay the same after sorting. Now, use the sorted function to write a function that takes in a shuffled deck and returns a sorted deck. It should sort cards of the same suit together, and then sort each card in each suit in increasing value."
